# Branch Reconciliation

## Contract

Release reconciliation must be driven by repository-tracked, reviewable tooling.
`make branches-unmerged-development` lists every local branch whose tip is not
reachable from the explicit `development` base. It uses ref names without
worktree marker decoration and sorts them deterministically.

An empty inventory prints a stable success message. The target is read-only: it
does not check out, merge, delete, or rewrite a ref. Every candidate still goes
through semantic review, focused verification, and the transactional
`development-merge-forward` target.

## Zero-downtime and observability

The inventory never changes a running service or repository state, so it cannot
cause deployment downtime. Its complete stdout is the observable handoff: a
branch is either named as a reconciliation candidate or the target explicitly
reports that every local branch is already reachable from development.

## Practitioner evidence

The official [git-branch manual](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch.html)
defines `--no-merged <commit>` in reachability terms and describes the result
as the candidate set for integration. The original
[2008 Git mailing-list patch](https://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg64057.html)
documents the long-lived practitioner use case: integration work across many
branches needs a direct list of merge candidates and a visible progress view.
That matches this project's release-forward workflow and is why the base is
spelled out as `development` instead of depending on whichever branch happens
to be checked out.
