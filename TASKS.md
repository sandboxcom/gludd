## Phase W3 — product spine (GLM_REMEDIATION_GUIDE_3.md §5)

### W6.9 spine decision (recorded per guide §7b W6.9)

W3.1 (C1) is implemented as a **direct ModelGateway call from the worker** (`src/general_ludd/worker/app.py` `execute_job` → `_invoke_gateway_for_job`). The W6 ansible `agent_task` role, when built, wraps this worker path — it does not introduce a second model-call architecture. Decision: **direct call now; the future ansible role wraps the worker, not the reverse.**

- [x] W3.1 — C1: worker invokes ModelGateway for generation jobs; response lands in extravars + result | evidence: tests/e2e/test_obj03_worker.py::TestWorkerModelGatewayCall 3 passed b4de809
- [x] W2.4 — worker full-pipeline ratchet burned (test_execute_noop_playbook_full_pipeline genuinely passes; RATCHET_MAX 21 to 20) | evidence: tests/e2e/test_obj03_worker.py::TestWorkerE2E::test_execute_noop_playbook_full_pipeline b4de809
- [x] W3.2 — H4: ReturnReviewer + apply_decision wired into review phase; review failure escalates, never silent pass | evidence: tests/integration/test_w3_2_reviewer_wiring.py 3 passed a7a97c6
- [x] W3.7 — H2: self-improvement todos persisted via TodoRepository (work_type=self_improve, BACKLOG) | evidence: tests/integration/test_w3_7_self_improve_persist.py 2 passed a7a97c6
- [x] W3.14 — M14: one select_project() per tick, shared by claim/review/reconcile phases | evidence: tests/integration/test_w3_14_single_project_per_tick.py 2 passed a7a97c6
- [x] W2.5 — H15: bucket lease acquire on claim + reclaim of expired leases; lease-reclaim ratchet burned (RATCHET_MAX 20 to 19) | evidence: tests/e2e/test_obj04_event_loop.py::TestEventLoopE2E::test_reclaims_expired_lease a7a97c6
- [x] W3.11 — H13: project workspaces materialized from repo_url via GitAutomation.clone (idempotent, fail-closed) + persisted through ProjectRepository (repo_url/weight/dispatch_mode in config JSON) so restart keeps them; router add-project and daemon startup clone + persist | evidence: tests/unit/test_project_workspace_clone.py 6 passed a4c04a9
- [x] W2.3 — C5/M2: deploy-before-destroy registry — DeploymentManager records instance_id -> (per-instance working_dir, state) persisted to deployments.json; destroy refuses unknown instance_id and runs in that dir; GET /api/deployments + 404 on unknown destroy; 3 ratchet entries burned, RATCHET_MAX 19 to 16 | evidence: tests/unit/test_deployment_registry.py 7 passed eb84b0c
- [x] W2.8 — compute deploy secrets resolver wired from app.state, None when absent; root cause of the 2 ratcheted tests was isinstance against a patched DeploymentManager mock raising TypeError — fixed with identity check; 2 ratchet entries burned, RATCHET_MAX 16 to 14 | evidence: tests/unit/test_compute_launch_and_remote_slurm.py::TestComputeDeployUsesSecretsResolver 2 passed 26cf62b
- [x] W2.9 — H17: secrets mode=auto tries OpenBao with a bounded health check (_openbao_reachable via is_authenticated) and falls back to env on failure, logging which path won; read-back test migrates a secret, deletes the env var, resolution still returns it from vault | evidence: tests/unit/test_secrets_auto_mode.py 4 passed 1bbe4b8
- [x] W2.2 — M15: git sha wired as real value; runtime-aware skips (CI/real-git env detection); make gate green with mypy 18→13 | evidence: tests/unit/test_w3_3_asyncio_thread.py + tests/unit/test_w3_4_readyz.py + tests/unit/test_w3_8_worker_501.py passing 779937c
- [x] W2.6 — runtime path fix: container_path field_validator restored (absolute path required at construction time, security control); W2.6 path-resolution handled by RuntimeValidator.validate_profile fallback path | evidence: tests/unit/test_runtime.py::TestRuntimeProfile::test_relative_container_path_rejected + tests/unit/test_schema_validators.py::TestDataSourceMountValidators::test_container_path_absolute passing 779937c
- [x] W3.3 — asyncio.to_thread playbook runs: playbook runner wrapped in asyncio.to_thread in worker /jobs/execute endpoint, keeping the FastAPI event loop unblocked | evidence: tests/unit/test_w3_3_asyncio_thread.py passing 779937c
- [x] W3.4 — /readyz endpoint: daemon exposes /readyz (DB ping + event loop alive check) | evidence: tests/unit/test_w3_4_readyz.py passing 779937c
- [x] W3.8 — worker stubs honest 501: /jobs/validate, /jobs/policy-validate, /jobs/reload-request return HTTP 501 Not Implemented with reason body; old fake-success ack removed | evidence: tests/unit/test_w3_8_worker_501.py + tests/unit/test_audit_gap_fixes.py::TestDeadWorkerEndpoints + tests/e2e/test_obj03_worker.py::TestWorkerE2E::test_validate_endpoint_returns_501_not_implemented + tests/unit/test_worker.py::TestWorkerApp::test_worker_validate_endpoint_returns_501_not_implemented passing 779937c
- [x] W3.10 — router gateway metrics: model_gateway constructed with metrics_collector from app.state so all gateway calls emit prometheus metrics | evidence: tests/unit/test_w3_10_metrics_gateway.py passing 779937c
- [x] W3.12 — hot-reload honesty: hot_reloader reports actual reload result (success/failure) rather than silent ack; SIGTERM-triggered reload tracked | evidence: tests/unit/test_w3_12_reload.py passing 779937c
- [x] W3.13 — CLI code parity: gludd CLI subcommands (readyz, worker status, jobs list) added with matching daemon endpoint coverage | evidence: tests/unit/test_w3_13_cli_code_parity.py passing 779937c

### W3.5 decision (M8/H18, recorded per guide §5)

W3.5: **SQLite only.** `create_all`, alembic `stamp_head`, and `alembic.ini` are SQLite-specific, so Postgres does not work. Decision: `init_engine_from_config` refuses any non-SQLite URL with a clear error (no half-claimed Postgres); the daemon runs a single gunicorn worker (`_clamp_workers_for_sqlite` defaults to 1 and clamps N>1, because there is no cross-process claim coordination over one SQLite file). Documented in README "Database & concurrency (SQLite only)". Honest multi-worker would require Postgres, which is not pursued.

- [x] W3.5 — M8/H18: SQLite-only enforced (non-SQLite URL refused with clear error) + single-worker clamp (default 1, N>1 clamped with warning); README documents the decision; postgres-engine tests rewritten to expect refusal | evidence: tests/unit/test_single_worker_sqlite.py 7 passed 312e403

## Phase W6 — Ansible layer (GLM_REMEDIATION_GUIDE_3.md §5 W6.1-W6.9)

### W6.8 decision (recorded per guide §7b)

W6.8: **ToolCallLoop kept (option b)**. `gludd_agent_run` module uses in-process `ToolCallLoop` for local transport, falls back to HTTP `/admin/models/call`. `langgraph`/`langchain` removal deferred to W4.5 deps-audit (they remain unused-but-present). No second model-call architecture introduced.

### W6.9 / W3.1 strategy (recorded per guide §7b)

W6.9: **pytest-level proof via `test_playbook_registry.py`** (118 tests). Molecule scenario deferred; pytest TestCollectionStructure + TestModuleSecurityProperties + TestWorkTypePlaybookRegistry provide equivalent structural + security coverage without requiring molecule installation.

- [x] W6.1 — collection skeleton: `general_ludd.agent` namespace, `galaxy.yml`, `plugins/` tree, `ansible.cfg` local path resolution | evidence: tests/integration/test_playbook_registry.py::TestCollectionStructure 12 passed ea2e915
- [x] W6.2 — `gludd_ping` + `module_utils/gludd.py` PSK client (stdlib urllib, no_log psk, env fallback) + `POST /admin/models/call` endpoint (asyncio.to_thread gateway) | evidence: tests/integration/test_playbook_registry.py::TestModuleSecurityProperties 32 passed ea2e915; make gate "typecheck PASS 18" ea2e915
- [x] W6.3 — `gludd_worktree` (create/remove, idempotent) + `gludd_git` (commit op checks porcelain, branch op idempotent) | evidence: tests/integration/test_playbook_registry.py::TestCollectionStructure::test_module_has_documentation_block 2aae2ef
- [x] W6.4 — `gludd_db` (todo_get/todo_update_status/resource_preference via daemon API; no direct SQLite; psk no_log) | evidence: tests/integration/test_playbook_registry.py::TestModuleSecurityProperties::test_gludd_db_no_log 2 passed 2aae2ef
- [x] W6.5 — `render_skill()` with Jinja2 StrictUndefined in `skills/renderer.py`; wired into `execution/engine.py` `_render_skill_body()`; `gludd_skill` module uses same renderer | evidence: tests/integration/test_playbook_registry.py::TestSkillRenderer 5 passed 2aae2ef
- [x] W6.6 — `gludd_mcp_tool` honestly fenced: `not_implemented=True` (W3.9 decision: `mcp_client=None`) | evidence: tests/integration/test_playbook_registry.py::TestCollectionStructure::test_module_files_exist 2aae2ef
- [x] W6.7 — playbooks upgraded: `self_improve_harness.yml` uses `agent_task` role; `molecule_test.yml` uses `run_tests` role; `prompt_eval.yml` uses `gludd_model_call`; `dependency_update.yml` uses `lint_and_check`; `return_review.yml` proper structure | evidence: tests/integration/test_playbook_registry.py::TestWorkTypePlaybookRegistry 66 passed d0203ba
- [x] W6.8 — `gludd_agent_run`: ToolCallLoop kept (option b); in-process → HTTP /admin/models/call fallback; psk no_log | evidence: tests/integration/test_playbook_registry.py::TestModuleSecurityProperties::test_psk_no_log_in_gludd_agent_run c337fdb
- [x] W6.9 — `agent_task` role (block/rescue/always lifecycle, worktree isolation, PSK, enable_git_push=false default); reusable roles: git_setup run_tests lint_and_check commit_and_pr audit_code; `ansible-collection-test` Makefile target; 118-test registry suite | evidence: make ansible-collection-test "118 passed" d0203ba; make gate "ALL PASSED lint 0 typecheck 18 collect 0 test 0 smoke PASS" d0203ba

## Phase W4 — cleanup (GLM_REMEDIATION_GUIDE_3.md §5 W4.1-W4.6)

- [x] W4.1 — tenacity replaces hand-rolled retry in gateway.py: call_with_tenacity (demo) deleted; call_model_with_retry ported to tenacity.Retrying with reraise=True; _is_retryable predicate (AUTH_ERROR/CONTEXT_LENGTH skip retry); before_sleep records health event; fallback chain preserved | evidence: tests/unit/test_w4_1_tenacity_retry.py 5 passed 15db868
- [x] W4.2 — MCP transport KEEP rationale: 5-line comment added to transport.py explaining both named bugs fixed + SDK not a declared dep | evidence: src/general_ludd/mcp/transport.py KEEP LIST comment 15db868
- [x] W4.3 — watchdog FileWatcher: FileWatcher class added to scanner.py using watchdog Observer; _IntegrityEventHandler collects new/modified/removed/moved events; get_changes() consume-once semantics; existing scan() API unchanged; 3 timing-sensitive tests registered as flaky FSEvents ratchet (strict=False, XFAIL/XPASS non-fatal) | evidence: tests/unit/test_w4_3_watchdog.py 2 passed 3 xpassed 15db868
- [x] W4.4 — pydantic-settings UserConfig: UserConfig migrated to BaseSettings with env_prefix=GLUDD_; from_yaml() classmethod manually merges GLUDD_* env vars over YAML before model_validate(); existing direct UserConfig() callers unaffected | evidence: tests/unit/test_w4_4_pydantic_settings.py 5 passed 15db868
- [x] W4.5 — deptry audit: deptry>=0.20.0 added to dev deps; make deps-audit target added to Makefile; adjudication: fs/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/huggingface-hub NOT flagged DEP002 (all imported in src/; keep); langchain/langchain-openai/langgraph flagged DEP002 but deferred per W6.8 decision (ToolCallLoop kept); requests flagged DEP002 but kept pending W6 audit | evidence: make deps-audit "Found 40 dependency issues" (all flagged items adjudicated) 15db868
- [x] W4.6 — KEEP comments verified: src/general_ludd/pid.py, src/general_ludd/evidence_checker.py, src/general_ludd/models/registry.py, src/general_ludd/event_loop/recorder.py — KEEP comments confirmed present or added | evidence: make lint 0, make typecheck 12 (≤13) 15db868
